# http-ResponderTester
Use the requests library to perform an HTTP request/response

Runs on local PC or on backend.
Does not run on a webpage front end.

This is makes a call to an api and displays the response headers and JSON
Currently it pulls data from a custom built serverless backend using AWS API Gateway and lambda.
The backend is mvp and needs to be expanded beyond only responding to get requests.
